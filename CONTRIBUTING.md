# Greetings, contributors!

- Have a look at the [Issues](https://github.com/tusharnankani/VocalForLocal/issues) section for issues that need to be solved!


## Local setup

- Select an issue and ask to be *assigned* to it.
- **Star** the repository.
- On the GitHub page of this repository, click on the Button "**Fork**".
  ![fork image](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/fork_button.jpg)
- Clone ***your forked repository*** on your local machine.
  ![code ui](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/code-button.png)

  For example, run this command inside your terminal:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/VocalForLocal.git
  ```
  **Replace \<your-github-username\>!**

  Learn more about [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Before you make any changes, [keep your fork in sync](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-git-repository/) to avoid merge conflicts:

  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/tusharnankani/VocalForLocal.git
  git fetch upstream
  git pull upstream master
  git push
  ```
- If you run into a **merge conflict**, you have to resolve the conflict. There are a lot of guides online, or you can try this one by [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/git-merge-conflict).
- Checkout to development branch (*name your branch according to the issue name*).

  ```bash
  git checkout -b <branch-name>
  ```
- Write your code, locally.
- Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` ([write a good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), if possible).
- I try to follow [this](https://harshkapadia2.github.io/git_basics/#_git_commit) commit structure:

  ```bash
  git add -A
  git commit -m "<your message>"
  ```
- Push the code *to your repository*.

  ```bash
  git push origin <branch-name>
  ```
- Go to the GitHub page of _your fork_, and **make a pull request**:

  ![pull request image](https://help.github.com/assets/images/help/pull_requests/choose-base-and-compare-branches.png)

  Read more about pull requests on the [GitHub help pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
- Now wait, until one of us *reviews your Pull Request*! If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification.
